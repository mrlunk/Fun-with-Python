This Python code is a basic implementation of the Space Invaders game using Pygame library.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the code:

1. The Pygame library is imported and the random module is also imported.
2. Pygame is initialized using the init() function.
3. The screen is set up with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 600 pixels using set_mode().
4. The game clock is set up using the Clock() function.
5. The player's attributes are set up, including the player image, width, height, starting coordinates, and speed.
6. The bullets' attributes are set up, including the bullet image, width, height, and speed.
7. The enemies' attributes are set up, including the enemy image, width, height, starting coordinates, and speed. In this case, 6 enemies are created in a row.
8. The game over text is set up using the SysFont() function.
9. The score text is set up using the SysFont() function.
10. A while loop is created to handle events, update the screen, and update the game clock.
11. The event queue is checked for a QUIT event or a SPACE key press to fire a bullet.
12. The player's movement is handled using the arrow keys.
13. The bullets are moved up the screen.
14. Any bullets that have gone off-screen are removed from the bullet list.
15. The enemies are moved horizontally across the screen, and if an enemy hits the edge of the screen, it is moved down and its horizontal direction is reversed.
16. If an enemy reaches the player's position, the game over text is displayed, the screen is updated, the game is paused for 3 seconds, and the game_running variable is set to False to end the game.
17. If a bullet hits an enemy, the bullet and enemy are removed, and the score is increased by 10.
18. The screen is filled with black, and the player, bullets, enemies, and score are drawn onto the screen.
19. The score text is updated with the current score.
20. The screen is updated.
21. The game clock is ticked to maintain a constant framerate of 60 frames per second.
22. Once the game loop is exited, Pygame is quit using the quit() function.

Basic Space Invaders game script in Python using Pygame Module
By: MrLunk 2023

Educational challenges: 
1. Change the script so a new level is started when all enemies are shot down.
2. Change the script so that with increasing levels the amount of enemies increases too.
3. etc...
